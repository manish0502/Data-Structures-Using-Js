# 📚 Stack in JavaScript

---

**Stack** is a data structure.  
When we talk about **stacks** in JavaScript, we refer to a collection of elements that follow a specific order for adding and removing items.

🧠 **This order is known as "Last In, First Out" (LIFO).**

That means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed — just like a pile of plates! 🍽️

---

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **Push** ➡️ Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop** ⬅️ Remove the element from the top of the stack.
- **Peek/Top** 👀 See the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty** 🔎 Check if the stack is empty.

> A stack of books 📚 — the last book placed on top is the first one you'll pick up.
