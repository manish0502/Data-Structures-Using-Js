# 📬 Queue in JavaScript

---

**Queue** is a fundamental data structure.  
When we talk about **queues** in JavaScript, we refer to a collection of elements that follow a specific order for adding and removing items.

🧠 **This order is known as "First In, First Out" (FIFO).**

That means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed — just like people standing in line! 🧍🧍‍♀️🧍‍♂️

## 📌 Key Concepts

- **Enqueue** ➕ Add an element to the end of the queue.
- **Dequeue** ➖ Remove the element from the front of the queue.
- **Front/Peek** 👀 View the element at the front without removing it.
- **IsEmpty** 🔎 Check if the queue is empty.

> ⚡ **Real-life example:**  
> A line at the ticket counter 🎟️ — the person who gets in line first is served first.
